### A Simple Pinyin Input Method
#### written by Liang Zhang in Javascript

A simple Pinyin Input Method implemented by trie data structure. The pinyin database can be generated by python program, or you can just use the default one I have already made.

Usage:
- install node.js dependency in `JsGenDB` folder
```bash
cd JsGenDB
npm install
```
- Generate pinyin database as db.json
```bash
node convert.js ../db.json
```
- open index.html locally or serve it as a web page
